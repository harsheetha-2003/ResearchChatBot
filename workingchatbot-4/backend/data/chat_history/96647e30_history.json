Stories of gods and monsters and the men and women who lived and interacted with them have caught the attention of children and adults alike for generations. As captivating as these stories are, they present a unique problem to the historian. Much can be gleaned from ancient mythology about the society from which the Greeks came, how they lived and what they thought about the world around them for example; but because of the nature of myth, it cannot be taken completely at face value. Myth deals with the fantastic, the supernatural, and the divine. Because of this, the function that mythology collectively played in the ancient world becomes historically more important than the interpretation of each individual myth. This discussion will be aimed at answering three basic questions about Greek mythology: 1) What is mythology, 2) What problems arise when studying"

They most probably used a type of ergot, a fungus that grows on barley, mixed into the drink.175  The play that took place was supposed to allow the initiate to experience the return of Persephone and her infant son, Iacchos. Then, in a ceremony not so unlike many religious services and artistic productions today that manipulate emotion through music and lighting, the Mystae would see the return of Persephone that Demeter so longed for. The viewers would chant, the priest would chant, the music would rise at the right moment, and the light would become darker; then the ghostly form of Persephone carrying her child would appear in a bright light just as a gong sounded and the priest yelled, \u201cThe Terrible Queen has given birth to her son, the Terrible One!\u201d176 The possibility of the play being part or all of a shared drug induced vision could account for much of why the Eleusian Mysteries are so hard for us to understand"

    "query": "what is the story of pomegranate of Persephone",
    "answer": "The story of the pomegranate of Persephone is a well-known myth in Greek mythology. Persephone, the daughter of Demeter, was abducted by Hades and taken to the underworld. While in the underworld, Hades offered Persephone pomegranate seeds to eat, which bound her to him. Persephone was eventually allowed to return to the surface world, but because she had eaten the seeds, she had to spend part of each year in the underworld. This myth explains the changing of the seasons, with Persephone's return symbolizing the arrival of spring and her descent representing the arrival of winter. This story highlights themes of life, death, and rebirth in Greek mythology."
