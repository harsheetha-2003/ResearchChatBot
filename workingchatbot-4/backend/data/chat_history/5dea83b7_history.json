Two 5-7 page analytic essays due somewhat on dates of your own choosing and selected from two distinct groups of three options each. The assignments are purposely diverse in substance, but all require, albeit in distinct ways, broad, systematic, and creative thinking about the material and themes of the course. Regardless of the subject, your challenge is neither to embark upon outside research nor to summarize the views of others but, rather, to analyze the assigned material, reflect on the issues at hand, and articulate\u2014and then support with evidence and analysis\u2014an argument that answers the question.

    "answer": "The objective of this paper is to introduce American political ideas, institutions, behaviors, and processes. The focus is on analyzing and interpreting political phenomena rather than memorizing names and dates. The course aims to explore power dynamics, structures, rules, incentives, interests, causes, conditions, and the art and science of contemporary American politics. The goal is to encourage students to think politically and holistically about how political actors and institutions operate within a complex system. Students are expected to engage with the course material, reflect on issues, and articulate arguments supported by evidence and analysis."

    "query": "list the linkages",
    "answer": "The linkages between the various readings and materials in the course can be seen through the examination of foundational documents such as The Declaration of Independence, The Articles of Confederation, and The Constitution. These documents are further analyzed and discussed in works like Madison's The Federalist papers and other scholarly articles. Additionally, there is a focus on the separation of powers within the government, as discussed by scholars like Madison and J.Q. Wilson, as well as current events such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha case. The course also delves into the functioning of Congress, the presidency, and the role of political parties in shaping policy, as evidenced by readings from authors like Mayhew and Hamilton. Overall, the linkages in the course highlight the interconnectedness of historical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and contemporary political issues within the American political system."
